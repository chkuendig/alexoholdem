#summary Replay model

  * A Replay is a sequence of Actions taken by a set of Avatars across a number of Rounds with some ChanceCards.
  * Avatars are always specified in clockwise-deal-last order, you can access them with the Replay.players() method.
  * You can access the chance cards with Replay.cards().
  * You can access actions with {{{Replay.action(forPlayer: Avatar): Iterable<Action>}}}.
  * You can build up a Replay using {{{addHole(Avatar, Hole)}}} and {{{addAction(Avatar, Action)}}}.<br>Note that as a minimum, when creating a Replay, you must provide: a list of Avatars, ChanceCards (possibly without Holes), and the Round.
  * StackedReplay represents a Replay together with a map from Avatars to ChipStacks.  These ChipStacks represent how much money each Avatar won/lost from the recorded hand.
