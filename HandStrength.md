See: https://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/1998/AAAI98-070.pdf section "Hand Strength".  This can also be used to help compute "Hand Potential".

  * Roll out all chance cards uniformly at random.
  * Count how many wins, losses, and ties you would experience if the game were to reach the showdown.
  * Hand strength = (wins + ties / 2) / (wins + losses + ties)
